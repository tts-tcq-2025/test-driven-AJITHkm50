# TDD Driven StringCalculator

Build a StringCalculator functionality that can take up to two numbers, separated by commas, and will return their sum. 
for example “” or “1” or “1,2” as inputs.

> DO NOT jump into implementation! Read the example and the starting task below.

- For an empty string it will return 0
- Allow the Add method to handle an unknown amount of numbers
- Allow the Add method to handle new lines between numbers (instead of commas).
  - the following input is ok: “1\n2,3” (will equal 6)
  - the following input is NOT ok: “1,\n” (not need to prove it - just clarifying)
- Support different delimiters : to change a delimiter, the beginning of the string will contain a separate line that looks like this: “//[delimiter]\n[numbers…]” for example “//;\n1;2” should return three where the default delimiter is ‘;’ .
the first line is optional. all existing scenarios should still be supported
- Calling Method with a negative number will throw an exception “negatives not allowed” - and the negative that was passed. if there are multiple negatives, show all of them in the exception message.
- Numbers bigger than 1000 should be ignored, so adding 2 + 1001 = 2
- Delimiters can be of any length with the following format: “//[delimiter]\n” for example: “//[***]\n1***2***3” should return 6

## Tasks



Establish quality parameters:

- Ensure  maximum complexity (CCN) per function == 3

- Ensure 100% line and branch coverage at every step

  

Start Test-driven approach

1. Write the smallest possible failing test: give input `"" assert output to be 0 ` .
2. Write the minimum amount of code that'll make it pass.
3. Refactor any assumptions, continue to pass this test. Do not add any code without a corresponding test.

This list covers all functional requirements and quality constraints for the StringCalculator TDD process.

## StringCalculator Test Specification Table

| Test Case ID | Name | Precondition | Input | Action | Expected Output / Exception | Comment |
|--------------|------|--------------|-------|--------|----------------------------|---------|
| TC01 | Empty string returns zero | Calculator instance | "" | Call add | 0 | Basic case |
| TC02 | Single number returns its value | Calculator instance | "1" | Call add | 1 | Single value |
| TC03 | Two numbers separated by comma | Calculator instance | "1,2" | Call add | 3 | Standard comma delimiter |
| TC04 | Unknown amount of numbers | Calculator instance | "1,2,3,4" | Call add | 10 | Multiple values |
| TC05 | New lines between numbers | Calculator instance | "1\n2,3" | Call add | 6 | Supports newline as delimiter |
| TC06 | Custom single-character delimiter | Calculator instance | "//;\n1;2" | Call add | 3 | Custom delimiter |
| TC07 | Custom multi-character delimiter | Calculator instance | "//[***]\n1***2***3" | Call add | 6 | Multi-character delimiter |
| TC08 | Negative numbers throw exception | Calculator instance | "1,-2,3" | Call add | Exception: "negatives not allowed: -2" | Exception for negative input |
| TC09 | Multiple negative numbers throw exception | Calculator instance | "1,-2,-3" | Call add | Exception: "negatives not allowed: -2, -3" | Exception lists all negatives |
| TC10 | Numbers greater than 1000 are ignored | Calculator instance | "2,1001" | Call add | 2 | Ignores numbers > 1000 |
| TC11 | Invalid delimiter format (not needed) | Calculator instance | "1,\n" | Call add | N/A | Not required to test, just for clarification |

## GHERKIN language

Feature: StringCalculator

Scenario: Empty string returns zero
    Given the input ""
    When I call add
    Then the result should be 0

Scenario: Single number returns its value
    Given the input "1"
    When I call add
    Then the result should be 1

Scenario: Two numbers separated by comma
    Given the input "1,2"
    When I call add
    Then the result should be 3

Scenario: Unknown amount of numbers
    Given the input "1,2,3,4"
    When I call add
    Then the result should be 10

Scenario: New lines between numbers
    Given the input "1\n2,3"
    When I call add
    Then the result should be 6

Scenario: Custom single-character delimiter
    Given the input "//;\n1;2"
    When I call add
    Then the result should be 3

Scenario: Custom multi-character delimiter
    Given the input "//[***]\n1***2***3"
    When I call add
    Then the result should be 6

Scenario: Negative numbers throw exception
    Given the input "1,-2,3"
    When I call add
    Then an exception should be thrown with message "negatives not allowed: -2"

Scenario: Multiple negative numbers throw exception
    Given the input "1,-2,-3"
    When I call add
    Then an exception should be thrown with message "negatives not allowed: -2, -3"

Scenario: Numbers greater than 1000 are ignored
    Given the input "2,1001"
    When I call add
    Then the result should be 2

Delimiter format validation scenario is not needed as per requirements
